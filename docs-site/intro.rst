Introduction
============

BetterMyAdmin is a free software tool written in TypeScript that is intended to
handle the administration of a MySQL or MariaDB database server. It is a
feature-for-feature port of phpMyAdmin to Node.js and React: the same pages,
the same configuration directives (with the same names and defaults) and the
same Docker variables, with a modern interface and no PHP. You can use
BetterMyAdmin to perform most administration tasks, including creating a
database, running queries, and adding user accounts.

BetterMyAdmin runs as one Node.js process, or as the Docker image
``ghcr.io/cb-sigma/better-myadmin``, that serves both the web application and
its API; it needs no web server in front of it. The intentional differences
from phpMyAdmin are listed, each with its rationale, in the `parity exceptions
register
<https://github.com/cB-Sigma/better-myadmin/blob/main/docs/reference/parity-exceptions.md>`_.

* k and CTRL+k - Toggle console
* CTRL+ALT+c   - Toggle console
* h - Go to home page
* s - Open the navigation panel settings
* e - Export
* d + s - Go to database structure (Provided you are in database related page)
* d + f - Search database (Provided you are in database related page)
* t + s - Go to table structure (Provided you are in table related page)
* t + f - Search table (Provided you are in table related page)
* backspace - Takes you to older page.
* ? - Show the list of shortcuts
* CTRL+SHIFT+p (CMD+SHIFT+p on macOS) - Open the command palette, see
  :ref:`command-palette`

A word about users
------------------

Many people have difficulty understanding the concept of user
management with regards to BetterMyAdmin. When a user logs in to
BetterMyAdmin, that username and password are passed directly to MySQL.
BetterMyAdmin does no account management on its own (other than allowing
one to manipulate the MySQL user account information); all users must
be valid MySQL users.

.. [#f1]

    BetterMyAdmin can compress (:term:`ZIP`, :term:`GZip` or :term:`RFC 1952`
    formats) dumps and :term:`CSV` exports; the compression is built in and
    needs no extra software.
